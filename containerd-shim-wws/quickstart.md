# Quickstart

## Pre-requisites
Before you begin, you need to have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) version 4.13.1 (90346) or later with [containerd enabled](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/containerd/)
- [k3d](https://k3d.io/v5.4.6/#installation)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
- [Wasm Workers Server binary](https://workers.wasmlabs.dev/quickstart)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Start and configure a k3d cluster

Start a k3d cluster with the WASM shims already installed:

```bash
k3d cluster create wasm-cluster --image ghcr.io/deislabs/containerd-wasm-shims/examples/k3d:v0.3.3 -p "8081:80@loadbalancer" --agents 2 --registry-create mycluster-registry:12345
```

Apply RuntimeClass for Wasm Workers Server applications to use the `wws` Wasm shim:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deislabs/containerd-wasm-shims/main/deployments/workloads/runtime.yaml
```

## Deploy an existing sample Wasm Workers Server application

Deploy a pre-built sample `wws` application:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deislabs/containerd-wasm-shims/main/deployments/workloads/workload.yaml
echo "waiting 5 seconds for workload to be ready"
sleep 5
curl -v http://0.0.0.0:8081/wws/hello
```

Confirm you see a response from the sample application. For example:

```output
$ curl -v http://0.0.0.0:8081/wws/hello
*   Trying 0.0.0.0:8081...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to 0.0.0.0 (127.0.0.1) port 8081 (#0)

This example is a website, so feel free to check it on your browser by accessing <http://0.0.0.0:8081/wws/hello>.

Delete the pre-built sample Wasm Workers Server application:

```bash
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deislabs/containerd-wasm-shims/main/deployments/workloads/workload.yaml
```

## Build and deploy a Wasm Workers Server application

Clone the [deislabs/containerd-wasm-shims](https://github.com/deislabs/containerd-wasm-shims) project and navigate to the `containerd-wasm-shims/images/wws` directory. This directory contains the source for the application you deployed in the previous section.

Note that Wasm Workers Server only requires the source code file for languages like JavaScript. You have more information about how it works in the [documentation](https://workers.wasmlabs.dev/docs/get-started/how-it-works).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deislabs/containerd-wasm-shims.git
cd containerd-wasm-shims/images/wws
```

## Run the application

Use `wws` to run the application on your development computer. For example:

```bash
wws .
```

The application is running at <http://localhost:8080/hello>.

Return to the terminal window running `wws` and stop the application.

## Create a container image for the application

Use `docker` to build the container image and push it to the k3d registry:

```bash
docker buildx build --platform=wasi/wasm -t localhost:12345/qs-wasm-wws .
docker push localhost:12345/qs-wasm-wws:latest
```

## Deploy the application

Create a `qs.yaml` file with the following:

```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wasm-wws
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wasm-wws
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wasm-wws
    spec:
      runtimeClassName: wasmtime-wws
      containers:
        - name: testwasm
          image: mycluster-registry:12345/qs-wasm-wws:latest
          command: ["/"]
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wasm-wws
spec:
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 3000
  selector:
    app: wasm-wws
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: wasm-wws
  annotations:
    ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "false"
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik
spec:
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: wasm-wws
                port:
                  number: 80
```

Deploy the application and confirm it is running:

```bash
kubectl apply -f qs.yaml
echo "waiting 5 seconds for workload to be ready"
sleep 5
curl -v http://0.0.0.0:8081/hello
```

Confirm you see a response from the sample application. For example:

```output
$ curl -v http://0.0.0.0:8081/hello
*   Trying 0.0.0.0:8081...
* TCP_NODELAY set

## Clean up

Remove the sample application:

```bash
kubectl delete -f qs.yaml
```

Delete the cluster:

```bash
k3d cluster delete wasm-cluster
```

## Next steps

Try running Wasm applications on [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wasm/) or on Kubernetes, such as [AKS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-wasi-node-pools).
